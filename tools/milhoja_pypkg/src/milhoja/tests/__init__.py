# ----- Python unittest-based test framework
# This package autodiscovers tests and has a high-level interface for running
# tests.  Therefore, there is generally no need to import test cases into the
# package/sub-package namespaces.
#
# However, this test case is a base class for building concrete test cases.
# Therefore, we manually include it.
