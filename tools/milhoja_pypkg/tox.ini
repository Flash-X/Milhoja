# Setup and manage python virtual environments that allow users to develop and
# test the Milhoja python package.
#
# TODO: It would be nice to have an env that runs on the oldest python version
# allowed using the oldest version of all dependencies allowed.  Can we write a
# requirements.txt file for that setup and read in the versions in setup.py to
# reduce duplicated information?
