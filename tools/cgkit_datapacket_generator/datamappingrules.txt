Every item in each JSON section is mapped accordingly:

Depending on the item's purpose in memory, it may have one of 2 suffixes attached to it.
Every item has 1 prefix attached to it. That prefix is always an underscore. '_'

If the item is contained within the host memory, the suffix will be '_h'.
If the item is contained within the device memory, the suffix will be '_d'.

For example, an auxC array pointer would be called '_auxC_d' because the pointer points to a place in device memory. (e.g. gpu memory)
Only constructor items will ever have a variable associated with it in host memory. For example, 'dt' would be stored in the packet as '_dt_h'.

The suffix '_p' is for items in pinned memory. Pinned memory items do not have a prefix and are only accessible from within the pack function.

In the cpp2c layer, the variables use the same name as the data packet.

In the c2f layer, variables are passed in with a 'C' in front of the variable name, and eventually copied over into fortran pointers, that start with 'F'.
