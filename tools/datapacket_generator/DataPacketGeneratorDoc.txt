Data packet generator documentation

A call to the data packet generator requires a JSON object of the format
specified in this documentation.

Keep in mind:
    If a scalar is being identified as a key, you must include the data type as the value of that key.
    If a vector or array type is being used as a key, that key must include keys in a dictionary. It must include
        1) The type that the array will store (eg, Real) and 
        2) The extents / dimensionality of that array.

All available json sections

Packet Metadata:

[Required]	
- name	= the name of the data packet to be generated.

[Optional]
- project = tbd

Other Sections:

[Required]

general:
    Non tile specific data goes in here. Number of tiles, dt, PacketContents, or any calculation constants should go here.
    Note: Number of tiles and PacketContents are generated automatically. You should not specify them in the packet.
    However, you must specify dt.

[optional]

tile-in
    The array type data that we want to copy into the gpu.
    Common option is CC1

tile-out
    The array types that we want to contain the outputs of the calculations done in the gpu.
    Common option is CC2

tile-metadata
    All of the data to be included per tile. Common options include hi, lo, and deltas.

tile-scratch
    All scratch arrays to be included per tile. Common options include FC[XYZ].

Note when specifying arrays:
When specifying array types, 2 things must be included. The type that the array stores and the extents of the array.
The number of unknown variables or fluxes must be specified at the end of the array.
