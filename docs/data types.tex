\section{Orchestration Namespace}

The Grid and Tile classes, as well as related classes and functions, live inside the Orchestration namespace.


\section{Real Type}

For the sake of flexibility in type-matching, the Orchestration System maintains its own floating point type: orchestration::Real. This is a typedef for either double or float, depending on the macro defined at compilation, REAL\_IS\_DOUBLE or REAL\_IS\_FLOAT.

\section{Vectors}
\subsection{IntVect}

The IntVect class represents NDIM-tuples of integers. Most frequently, they represent vectors in the index-space of the domain. Users are responsible of tracking whether they represent cell-based or node-based indices. They have basic math operators defined, such as component-wise addition, scalar multiplication, etc.



\subsection{RealVect}

The RealVect class represents NDIM-tuples of Reals. They typically represent points of the domain in physical space. They also have basic math operators defined.
